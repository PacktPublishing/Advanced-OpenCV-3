# Advanced OpenCV 3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Advanced OpenCV 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/advanced-opencv-3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788297219), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
OpenCV 3 is a native cross-platform C++ Library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. This impressive API also makes starting OpenCV 3 projects a daunting prospect. Each video in this course provides a practical and innovative approach so youâ€™ll be able to choose wisely in your future projects. It will help you tackle increasingly challenging computer vision problems that you may face in your career. Each of the examples have been battle-tested in the authorâ€™s industry research. 

Youâ€™ll deep dive into video surveillance tools, such as wildlife camera traps, extreme sports cameras, and closed circuit video cameras. Many applications require video content analysis, so youâ€™ll learn about video stabilization, background video monitoring, and subtraction. Moving ahead, youâ€™ll find out about object detection robot vision, where youâ€™ll match image descriptors. Youâ€™ll also get an overview of image warping and the perspective transform, and will use homographies to warp images. 

Finally, explore into Artificial Intelligence with Deep Neural Networks and youâ€™ll get a taste of how DNNs can be used within OpenCV. Youâ€™ll see how to install and load DNN models and classify images. At the end of the course, youâ€™ll discover how to convert low-level pixel information to high-level concepts for applications such as object detection, recognition, and scene monitoring.
